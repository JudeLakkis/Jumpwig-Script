<h1 align="center">Jumpwig Script</h1>

This script just works on my computer at the moments as it is set up for my screen dimensions. This is just a little hobby project that I thought would be fun to practice some python work. It is currently about a second faster that world record, and I'll get it even lower in the future. Just some fun, ignore it.
